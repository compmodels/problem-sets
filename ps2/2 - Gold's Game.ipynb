    "For this problem, you will write code to implement the language-learning game explained in lecture and described by Gold in his 1967 paper. The game is intended to be a formal model of the way in which people learn natural languages. In the game, there is a learner who is trying to learn the language and a teacher who is supplying the learner with examples of valid sentences from the language. For our convenience, we will represent each sentence with a single number and each language as a set of valid sentences (numbers). In this version of the game, we will assume that there are only 10 possible languages: $L_1$, $L_2$, ... , $L_{10}$, and that each language $L_i$ contains the sentences 1 through $i$, so $L_1 = \\{1\\}$, $L_2 = \\{1,2\\}$, $L_3 = \\{1,2,3\\}$, ..., and $L_{10} = \\{1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10\\}$.\n",
    "\n",
    "The game proceeds as follows: the teacher first selects a target language that the learner must learn. The teacher then generates examples of valid sentences from the target language and tells them to the learner one at a time (we will assume that the teacher chooses each example randomly from the set of valid sentences). Each time the learner sees a new sentence, they get one guess for what the target language is, based on all the observed sentences seen so far. In our version of the game, the game will be over when the learner correctly guesses the target language. The learner’s strategy should be to always guess the first language that is compatible with the sentences seen so far. So if the sequence of observed sentences were $\\{3,1,1,2,1,3,2\\}$, the learner should guess $L_3$, and if the observed sentences were $\\{2,9\\}$, the learner should guess $L_9$."
