    "One simple Turing machine program is the program which identifies whether a binary string is a palindrome. For our purposes, a palindrome is defined as an input for which the first half is a \"mirror image\" of the second half. For example, a string like \"ABBA\" is a palindrome, while \"ABAB\" is not.\n",

    "### Input tape\n",
    "We will provide input to the TM in the form of a Python `list` of symbols from our alphabet, where each element in the list represents a different cell on the tape. We use a special symbol, $*$, to indicate the end of our input. In the following program, we assume that our alphabet consists only of symbols in the set $\\{A, B, *\\}$. \n",
